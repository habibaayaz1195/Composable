/**
 * This object is used to keep track of custom information about a company.
            
The company settings system is a metadata system that you can use to store extra information
about a company.  Your integration or connector could use this data storage to keep track of
preference information, reminders, or any other storage that would need to persist even if
the customer uninstalls your application.
            
A setting can refer to any type of data you need to remember about this company object.
When creating this object, you may define your own `set`, `name`, and `value` parameters.
To define your own values, please choose a `set` name that begins with `X-` to indicate an extension.
