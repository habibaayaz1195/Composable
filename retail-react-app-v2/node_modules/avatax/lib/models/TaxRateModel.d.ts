/**
 * Contains information about the general tangible personal property sales tax rates for this jurisdiction.
            
This rate is calculated by making assumptions about the tax calculation process.  It does not account for:
            
* Sourcing rules, such as origin-and-destination based transactions.
* Product taxability rules, such as different tax rates for different product types.
* Nexus declarations, where some customers are not obligated to collect tax in specific jurisdictions.
* Tax thresholds and rate differences by amounts.
* And many more custom use cases.
